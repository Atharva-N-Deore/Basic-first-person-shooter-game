# Basic-first-person-shooter-game

Hey, I made a first person shooting game using unreal engine 5.
You are spawned into a map with a pistol.
Left click to fire red bullets, and right click to fire blue ones.
There's multiple enemies on the map, who roam around randomly, so try to shoot them.
The red colored enemies can only be taken down by red bullets, and it's the same for the blue.
You have a health bar, and each time you hit the wrong enemy, it drops by 10%
Hold shift to sprint, or use ctrl for toggle shift.

Its a simple game, if you die, the map simply restarts.
Explore the map, kill all the enemies, and have fun!
